## 1. problem definition 
### Fake news is one of the most controversial issues at the moment.
#### Currently, fake news, which does not know many sources, is spreading openly among the public. These fake news usually cause problems on social media by intentionally creating false stories for the parties, groups, or groups they support, or just for simple fun. These writings spread quickly without the writer having to take responsibility and without proof, but they create great influence in all aspects of politics, society and culture. Another problem is that the representative places where fake news is generated and spread are various social networking sites, cafes, and gallery sites that people use a lot.

## 2. Solution 
### Don't judge the truth
#### Basically, it only provides good information for determining fake news. It only shows how much has been posted on character searches, company websites, news searches and other websites. If there is no information on character searches, companies, or news, and articles are only circulated on community sites, it is highly likely to be fake news. Therefore, they provide such search results or tools to search for.It does not confirm whether it is true or not. Only check if information is deliberately spread. Analyze the rate at which information spreads to determine whether someone is deliberately spreading it.
